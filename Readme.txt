How the code has been written:
- One commit contains broken unit test to show the test-first approach development;
- once the code has been done the acceptance test passes, until then it just show that the work is in progress;

How to run it:
- run ConsoleApp from Visual Studio or double click "PrimeNumbers.UI.ConsoleApp.exe" in windows explorer;

What I would do with it if you had more time:
- improve PrimeNumberGenerator;
- add more tests for input validation to PrimeTable, PrimeNumberGenerator, TabDelimitedTablePrinter classes;
